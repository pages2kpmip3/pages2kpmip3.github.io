  description: "In addition to presentations on the state of the science around
  data model comparisons, the workshop will also seek to organize participants
  into working groups that will lead preliminary analyses comparing simulations
  and proxy data.  These groups will explore best practices for hydroclimate
  data-model comparisons and their implications for model evaluation and the
  dynamics of hydroclimate events.  The possibility of using data-model comparisons
  for constraining future projetions will also be explored."

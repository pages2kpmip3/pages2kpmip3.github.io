- name: State of the science
  description: "Participants will review the present state of the science
  regarding: (1) the interpretation and availability of hydroclimate proxies and reconstructions;
  (2) the role of internal variability and external forcings in the last-millennium
  simulations and the implications for hydroclimate; (3) the most appropriate techniques
  for data-model comparisons, both for local hydroclimate proxies and syntheses;
  and (4) techniques for data assimilation and forward modeling."

- name: Data-model comparisons
  description: " A team of participants will organize themselves to lead
  preliminary diagnostic analyses between existing simulations and datasets
  and investigate suitable methods for data-model comparisons involving hydroclimate."

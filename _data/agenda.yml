  description: "1. Participants will review the present status of the knowledge
  on (1) the interpretation and availability of hydroclimate proxies and reconstructions;
  (2) the role of internal variability and external forcings in the last-millennium
  simulations and the implications for hydroclimate; (3) the most appropriate techniques
  used for data-model comparison both for local hydroclimate proxies and syntheses;
  and (4) techniques for data assimilation and forward modeling."

  description: " 2. A team of participants will organize themselves to lead
  preliminary diagnostic analyses between existing simulations and datasets
  and investigate suitable methods for data-model comparisons involving hydroclimate."

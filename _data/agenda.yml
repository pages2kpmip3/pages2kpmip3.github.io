- name: State of the science
  description: "Participants will review the present state of the science
  regarding: (1) the interpretation and availability of hydroclimate proxies and reconstructions;
  (2) the role of internal variability and external forcings in the last-millennium
  simulations and the implications for hydroclimate; (3) the most appropriate techniques
  for data-model comparisons, both for local hydroclimate proxies and syntheses;
  and (4) techniques for data assimilation and forward modeling."

- name: Data-model comparisons
  description: "In addition to presentations on the state of the science around
  data model comparisons, the workshop will also seek to organize participants
  into working groups that will lead preliminary analyses comparing simulations
  and proxy data.  These groups will explore best practices for hydroclimate
  data-model comparisons and their implications for model evaluation and the
  dynamics of hydroclimate events.  The possibility of using data-model comparisons
  for constraining future projetions will also be explored."

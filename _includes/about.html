This is a joint workshop between the PAGES 2K network of PAGES and the PAST2K working group of PMIP (Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project).
The meeting will be held on June 1-3, 2016 at the <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/">Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</a> of Columbia University, Palisades, NY, USA.

This aims of the workshop are to:<br><br>
1) promote discussion and collaboration across the PAGES2k and PMIP3 communities,<br>
2) review Common-Era proxy archives appropriate for hydroclimate assessment,<br>
3) review the current ensemble of coupled model simulations of the Common Era,<br>
4) review and refine best practices for model-data comparisons of hydroclimate over the Common Era,<br>
5) advance understanding of model assessments and constraints on future projections using model-data comparisons of hydroclimate over the Common Era,<br>
6) define future goals, products and timelines for collaborations between the PAGES2k and PMIP3 communities, specifically with regard to hydroclimate.<br><br>

Please note that the number of workshop participants will be limited to 30-50 people in order to promote productive and interactive exchanges. A limited amount of support (covering travel and accommodation expenses) will be available for young scientists or researchers from developing countries.  If you are interested in attending the workshop, please send a brief email to <a href="mailto:pages2k.pmip3@gmail.com">pages2k.pmip3@gmail.com</a> by <b>March 15, 2016</b> in which you describe your interest in the workshop and your area of expertise.  Invitations will be granted based on how well these descriptions match the planned agenda and the objectives of the workshop.<br><br>

                    Hydroclimate is an increasing focus of the paleoclimate community and the last several years have seen important data products developed to study hydroclimate variability and change during the Common Era. A growing collection of proxy records have been selected and discussed by the PAGES 2K regional working groups and hydroclimate is targeted as the next key variable of study.
            <br><br>
                    At the same time, an explosion in the number of last-millennium simulations using fully-coupled climate models has occurred over the last several years.  In particular, the PMIP3 effort included a last-millennium protocol and multiple modeling centers performed the experiment, using the same configurations and resolutions adopted for the historical and future projection simulations in CMIP5.  More recently, ensembles of last-millennium simulations have been performed that include single forcing experiments.  All of these developments make the time ripe for exploring how climate models simulate hydroclimate change and variability and whether they do so in ways that are consistent with the paleoclimate record.  Ultimately, comparisons between proxy records and model simulations will further enhance our abilities to evaluate climate models, understand the dynamics of hydroclimate variability and change, and constrain our characterizations of climate risks in the future.

                    A more detailed agenda will be provided here closer to the dates of the meeting.  In the meantime, the two main organizational thems of the workshop will be structured as follows:

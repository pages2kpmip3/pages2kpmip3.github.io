                        After the completion of the scientific workshop, two dozen middle and high school educators attended an outreach event designed to present the major themes of workshop focus and to give the teachers an opportunity to interact with scientists in an informal and interactive setting. The event started with presentations by workshop attendees Gavin Schmidt and Kim Cobb discussing their two different approaches to studying Earthâ€™s climate history, one through the use of computer modeling of the climate system and the other through the use of paleoclimatic records. A question and answer session followed the two presentations, afterwhich the teachers were given a chance to divide into small groups and pursue discussions with additional scientists from the workshop to discuss their research and ideas for inquiry-based learning activities for high-school students. <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/news-events/connecting-teachers-cutting-edge-science" target='_blank'>An Earth Institute news piece on the event is available here.</a>
